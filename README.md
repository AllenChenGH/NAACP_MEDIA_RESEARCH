Filter news about black people: make sure you've already generated (by run [combine.py](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/blob/master/combine.py) on [raw data](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/tree/master/raw%20data) or downloaded [classified data](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/tree/master/classified%20data), then run [keywords_filter_black.py](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/blob/master/keywords_filter_black.py). The results should be generated in [relevent data](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/tree/master/relevant%20data) folder.

Calculate coverage: make sure you've already generated (by run [combine.py](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/blob/master/combine.py) on [raw data](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/tree/master/raw%20data)) or downloaded [classified data](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/tree/master/classified%20data), then run [coverage.py](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/blob/master/coverage.py). The result should be printed on your screen. It's also recorded in [statistics_final.xlsx](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/blob/master/statistics_final.xlsx) sheet one.

Sentiment analysis: make sure you've already generated (by run [combine.py](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/blob/master/combine.py) on [raw data](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/tree/master/raw%20data) and [keywords_filter_black.py](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/blob/master/keywords_filter_black.py) on [classified data](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/tree/master/classified%20data) or downloaded [classified data](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/tree/master/classified%20data) and [relevent data](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/tree/master/relevant%20data), then run [sentiment_analysis_black.py](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/blob/master/sentiment_analysis_black.py) and [sentiment_analysis_all.py](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/blob/master/sentiment_analysis_all.py). The results should be stored in [sentiment_analysis_black.csv](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/blob/master/sentiment_analysis_black.csv) and [sentiment_analysis_all.csv](https://github.com/AllenChenGH/NAACP_MEDIA_RESEARCH/blob/master/sentiment_analysis_all.csv).
